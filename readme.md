# About

This is a simple calorie counter app built with vanilla JavaScript. It tracks your meals and workouts, and calculates the total calories burned and consumed.

This is part of Brad Traversy's [**Modern JS From The Beginning 2.0**](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0) course. I highly recommend it!

All of the code/classes I've written are in the `app.js` file.
