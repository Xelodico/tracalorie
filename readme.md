# About

This is a simple calorie counter app built with vanilla JavaScript. It tracks your meals and workouts, calculating the total calories consumed and burned.

This project is part of Brad Traversy's [**Modern JS From The Beginning 2.0**](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0) course. I highly recommend it!

All of the JavaScript code I've written is located in the `app.js` file.
